## Requesting access to Monitors

Editing a monitor requires you to have edit access for that specific monitor.

To get edit access for a monitor, you will first need to be a member of the team that owns the monitor.

Once you have joined the team, navigate to the monitor in question in Postman. In the upper right, hover over the monitor and select **...** > **Edit**.

When your request for access is approved, you will receive a notification in Postman.

## Approving requests for access

Your team members can request access from you in the following cases:

1. If your team members have the link to a personal collection, API, or monitor, they won't be able to view it, but they will be able to see the name and request access to it.

2. If you have the Editor role on a collection, API, or monitor that is shared, a team member who has the Viewer role will be able to request an additional role from you.

> The Viewer role is available depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing).

You will receive an email detailing the request for access.

Click **Approve Request** if you want to grant access to the collection, API, or monitor. If you do not wish to give access, you can ignore the request. A request for access will expire in 15 days.
