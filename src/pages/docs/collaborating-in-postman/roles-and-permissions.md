## Roles in Postman

As a team admin, you have the power to define Postman access at the team level. You can utilize Postman's role-based access control system to limit visibility of team resources, define your development workflow, and provide access to administrative personnel. Team members with the billing role can modify who else has billing roles at the team level.

Workspace admins can modify the admin and collaborator roles for the workspace. Editors of particular elements (APIs, collections, environments, monitors, and mock servers) can modify the editor and viewer role on the element.

With these roles, you and your teammates can manage access for each individual, or, if you are on a [Postman Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), for [groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).

### Team roles

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/) one or more role types to team members: **Admin**, **Billing**, and **Developer**. If you are on a [Postman Business or Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you will also have the option of assigning a **Community Manager**.

* **Admin**: manage team members and team settings
* **Billing**: manage team plan and payments
* **Developer**: access team resources and workspaces
* **Community Manager**: manage public visibility of workspaces and team profile (Business and Enterprise plans only)

Each user must have at least one role attached to them, and can hold multiple roles simultaneously.

Team roles provide high-level access control:

| Permission | Admin | Billing | Developer | Community Manager |
| --- |:---:| --- | --- | --- |
| Add users | &#x2714; | | |
| Remove users | &#x2714; | | |

| View usage data | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714;
| Manage Billing members | | &#x2714; | |
| Manage payment | | &#x2714; | | |

| Approve requests to change workspace visibility&ast;&ast; | | | | &#x2714;
| Enable public team profile | &#x2714; | | | &#x2714;

&ast; On Postman Team and Free plans, any developer can change visibility of workspaces

&ast;&ast; Enterprise and Business plans only

### Workspace roles

You can [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles) three role types in Postman workspaces: **Admin**, **Editor** and **Viewer**.

* **Admin:** Can manage workspace resources and settings
* **Editor:** Can create and edit workspace resources
* **Viewer:** Can view, fork, and export workspace resources

The following roles control access at a workspace level:

| Action | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create workspaces | &#x2714; | | |
| Delete workspaces | &#x2714; | | |
| Edit workspace details | &#x2714; | | |
| Join and leave workspaces | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; |
| Add members | &#x2714; | | |
| Remove members | &#x2714; | | |
| Manage workspace roles | &#x2714; | | |
| Manage workspace visibility | &#x2714;&ast; | | |
| Add and remove APIs, collections, and environments | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | |
| Manage integrations | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | |
| Add monitors and mock servers | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | |
| Send requests | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; |

&ast; On Business and Enterprise plans, workspace admins must request to change a workspace's visibility to public. This request will go to the [Community Manager](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles). On Team and Free plans, or if a team has no Community Manager assigned, workspace admins can control visibility.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/) two role types in Postman APIs: **Editor** and **Viewer**.

| ---   |   ---     | ---   |
| Edit and delete APIs |  &#x2714;     |     |

## Managing roles and permissions

To manage team roles, see [Managing roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/).

## Roles FAQ

* **Our only team member with billing/admin permissions left - what can I do?**
Contact us via our [Support Center](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us) for assistance.

* **I'm an admin, why can't I assign the billing role?**
Billing roles can only be granted by a fellow team member with a billing role. If this is not possible, contact us via our [Support Center](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us) for assistance.

* **Is there a "Super Admin" role?**
A "Super Admin" role is being considered for development. You can track progress and upvote [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/6102) to show your support.

* **Our colleague left the organization, how can we access their collections?**
You can remove a former colleague from your Postman team via your [dashboard](https://go.postman.co/team). When a collection owner is removed from your team, ownership of their shared collections is transferred to fellow team members and these collections will continue to exist in your Postman team.

* **What are "support" roles?**
A support-only account is one that holds an admin and/or billing role, but is not a developer.
Teams can have up to two support-only accounts.
