With Postman groups, you can organize your team members into functional groups that mimic your organizational structure. These groups allow you to efficiently manage access control across your team and seamlessly onboard new team members.

You must be a [Postman team admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to create, manage, and delete groups.

## Creating a group

As a team admin, you can create a group by navigating to Postman, selecting **Home** in the upper-left corner, then **Manage Team** on the left side. Alternatively, select **Team** in the upper-right corner > **Manage Team**.

Above your list of team members, select **Groups** > **Create Group**.

Give your group a name and description, add your team members, and select the team roles you would like to assign to the group, then **Create Group**.

>Note that you must have the billing role yourself to assign the billing role to others.

> Team members will receive an email and in-app notification when added to a group.

<!-- -->
> If a team member with a support-only account (admin and/or billing) is given the **Developer** role via a group they are in, they will automatically take up an available paid spot on your Postman team. If no spots are available, you will not be able to grant access to the group with that team member.
