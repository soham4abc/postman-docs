Postman workspaces allow you to organize and collaborate on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share APIs, collections, environments, and other components of your work in Postman.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace, but you can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work in conjunction with teammates.

> To create additional workspaces, you need to be signed into a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

To access your workspaces, select **Workspaces** in the upper left. You can search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select from the dropdown list.

Click __Create Workspace__ to add a new workspace.

Enter a __Name__ and optional __Summary__ for your workspace, then determine its visibility.

You can choose a __Team__ workspace if you plan to invite collaborators, a __Personal__ workspace, or a __Private__ workspace which is only visible to the user who created it and team members who have been invited to join it.

Select __Create Workspace__.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can then start working or [__Invite__](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#sharing-workspaces) people to join your new workspace. Move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper left.
