The Postman Public API Network is the largest network of APIs, workspaces, and collections by developers across the planet. Many of the teams and companies responsible for leading-edge APIs and technologies have public workspaces you can explore. Popular third-party APIs are also published, along with numerous examples you can use as a starting point when writing your own APIs or collections.

To access the Public API Network, visit [postman.com/explore](https://www.postman.com/explore) or select **Explore** at the top left of Postman.

There are a variety of ways to find APIs, workspaces, teams, and collections:

* **In the spotlight** highlights the latest exciting, useful, and noteworthy contributions to the Public API network, handpicked by the experts at Postman.
* **Trending workspaces, collections, and APIs** shows entities that are the most popular in the Public API Network, based on the number of people viewing or creating forks of them.
* The **Search Postman** box at the top of the page searches all of Postman by default, but you can also use the search controls to limit a search to only the Public API Network.
* There are links to the left to view **Teams**, **Workspaces**, **APIs**, and **Collections**. When you open each of these, the results page will also have categories you can explore on the left. Also, you can sort results using the **Featured**, **Most Viewed**, and **Latest** tabs just below the header.

To import a collection from a public workspace to your workspace, create a fork of it. See [forking a collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/#forking-a-collection).
