Postman Collections are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. However, as your Postman usage grows, it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

Let's review how to [send a basic request](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) and create a new collection.

## Creating your first collection

You can create a new request from the left sidebar in Postman. Click __New__ &gt; __HTTP Request__.

Enter a request in the request builder and click **Save** to open the **SAVE REQUEST** modal.

1. Create a new collection by selecting **New Collection**. Enter a collection name, and then select the **Create** button.

1. Select **Save** to save the request in the new collection.

Congratulations! You can see all of your collections under the **Collections** tab of the sidebar on the left, as illustrated below:

**Note:** You can also create a new collection from your workspace's **Overview** tab. Under **In this workspace** on the right of Postman, hover over **Collections** and select the **+** icon.
