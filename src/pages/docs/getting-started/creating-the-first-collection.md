Postman Collections are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. However, as your Postman usage grows, it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

Let's review how to [send a basic request](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) and create a new collection.

## Creating your first collection

1. Create a new request from the left sidebar in Postman. Select __New__ &gt; __HTTP Request__.

    To create a new request from the workspace overview tab, go to the **Get started** section at the right and select **Create a request**.

1. Enter a request in the request builder, then select **Save**. For more details, see [Sending your first request](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/).
    * As an optional step, enter a new request name. Otherwise, the default name will be the request URL.
    * As an optional step, enter a request description in plain text or using [Markdown](https://documenter.postman.com/view/33232/markdown-in-api-documentation/JsGc?version=latest).

1. Create a new collection by selecting **New Collection**. Enter a collection name, and then select the **Create** button.

1. Select **Save** to save the request in the new collection.

Congratulations! You can see all of your collections under the **Collections** tab of the sidebar on the left, as illustrated below:
