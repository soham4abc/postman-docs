Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps) is a real-time incident management platform that combines the power of people and data to handle incidents as they occur and prepare for the next one.

This integration allows you to configure [Postman Monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to trigger incidents on Splunk On-Call whenever it fails.

## Incidents on Splunk On-Call

An incident on Splunk On-Call consists of basic information from a monitor that has failed, including the number of errors and failed tests. It also provides a direct link to the failing monitor. This integration automatically acknowledges a triggered incident if the subsequent run succeeds.
