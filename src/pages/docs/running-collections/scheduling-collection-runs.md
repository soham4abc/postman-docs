You can automate [collection runs](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) using [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to schedule runs and receive reports on your request test results.

To add or access monitors for a particular collection, select the __Monitors__ tab in the left sidebar of Postman.

Any monitors already attached to your collection will appear. Click __Create a monitor__ to add one (or __+ Create a new Monitor__ if you already have one on the collection). You can also add a monitor via a collection. To add a monitor via collection, go to the collection, click __...__ and select __Monitor Collection__.

Give your monitor a name, select a collection to use, choose a version tag, and an optional environment your scheduled collection runs should reference. Enter the frequency you want your monitor to run on, and select a region. Click __Create__ and your monitor will run on the schedule you entered.

Your new monitor will appear in the monitor overview. You can open the monitor overview tab to [view your monitor results](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/) at any time.
